Hi, this is a project that uses opencv for face recognition attendence system. The software will recognize the face using the webcam and then mark the attendence in the "attendence.csv" file. The "attendence.py" file does all the heavy lifting with webcam and attendence system. The "main.py" is like a short version or program that focuses on just ml part of the program. It is just a testing file to be honest.
